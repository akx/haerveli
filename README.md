Haerveli modular sound generator
by Perttu Lindroos

The application uses the engine executable (FmSynth.exe) so you need to
build the engine first. For debugging, you need to copy the FmSynth.exe
to Application/Haerveli/bin/Debug. The installer project refers to the
FmSynth.exe in Engine/Release directly.

Have fun!
